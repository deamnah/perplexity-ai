# Perplexity
This module uses [emailnator](https://emailnator.com/) to generate new accounts. As you know, when you create a new account, you will have 5 pro queries. This module will generate you new gmails with [emailnator](https://emailnator.com/) and you will have unlimited pro queries.

## How to Install

```sh
pip install perplexity-api perplexity-api-async
```

and patchright if you are going to use web interface

```sh
pip install patchright playwright && patchright install chromium
```

## How To Use Web Interface
If you're just a normal user who wants to use Perplexity Pro/Reasoning unlimited and not interested in using Perplexity API in python codes, then you can use Web Interface feature. It will simply create accounts in background for you and when you run out of copilots, the new account will automatically open in new tab. [Patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-python#best-practices) uses [chrome user data directory](https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+user+data+directory) to be completely undetected, it's mostly ``C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data`` for Windows, as shown below,

```python3
import os
from perplexity.driver import Driver

cli = Driver()

cli.run(rf'C:\Users\{os.getlogin()}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data')
```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6862a53c-d574-4229-a203-0a47bba4af60

You can use your own chrome instance for Web Interface too. To do this, you need to add ``--remote-debugging-port=****`` argument to chrome execution command as [explained here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75431084). Ok, let's hammer it home for Windows 11. Type "Chrome" to your Windows search bar, right click to Chrome, click "Open file location". You will see the shortcut of Chrome, right click it, click "Properties" and add ``--remote-debugging-port=9222`` to end of "target" section. It is ``"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222`` in my end. After setting port, you can use "port" argument of ``Driver.run()``,

```python3
import os
from perplexity.driver import Driver

cli = Driver()

cli.run(rf'C:\Users\{os.getlogin()}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data', port=9222)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Using existing Chrome Instance isn't completely undetected. It may enter dead loop in Cloudflare verify page. The only way to bypass it is creating a new instance (so not using "port").

## How To Use API
Below is an example code for simple usage, without using your own account or generating new accounts.

```python3
import perplexity

perplexity_cli = TEST.Client()

# mode = ['auto', 'pro', 'reasoning', 'deep research']
# model = model for mode, which can only be used in own accounts, that is {
#     'auto': [None],
#     'pro': [None, 'sonar', 'gpt-4.5', 'gpt-4o', 'claude 3.7 sonnet', 'gemini 2.0 flash', 'grok-2'],
#     'reasoning': [None, 'r1', 'o3-mini', 'claude 3.7 sonnet'],
#     'deep research': [None]
# }
# sources = ['web', 'scholar', 'social']
# files = a dictionary which has keys as filenames and values as file data
# stream = returns a generator when enabled and just final response when disabled
# language = ISO 639 code of language you want to use
# follow_up = last query info for follow-up queries, you can directly pass response from a query, look at second example below
# incognito = Enables incognito mode, for people who are using their own account
resp = perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='auto', model=None, sources=['web'], files={}, stream=False,
                             language='en-US', follow_up=None, incognito=False)
print(resp)

# second example to show how to use follow-up queries and stream response
for i in perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', stream=True, follow_up=resp):
    print(i)
```

And this is how you use your own account, you need to get your cookies in order to use your own account. Look at [How To Get The Cookies](#how-to-get-the-cookies),

```python3
import perplexity

perplexity_cookies = {
                     < your
cookies
here >
}

perplexity_cli = TEST.Client(perplexity_cookies)

resp = perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='reasoning', model='o3-mini', sources=['web'],
                             files={'myfile.txt': open('file.txt').read()}, stream=False, language='en-US',
                             follow_up=None, incognito=False)
print(resp)
```

And finally account generating, you need to get cookies for [emailnator](https://emailnator.com/) to use this feature. Look at [How To Get The Cookies](#how-to-get-the-cookies),

```python3
import perplexity

emailnator_cookies = {
                     < your
cookies
here >
}

perplexity_cli = TEST.Client()
perplexity_cli.create_account(emailnator_cookies)  # Creates a new gmail, so your 5 pro queries will be renewed.

resp = perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='reasoning', model=None, sources=['web'],
                             files={'myfile.txt': open('file.txt').read()}, stream=False, language='en-US',
                             follow_up=None, incognito=False)
print(resp)
```

<details>
<summary><h2>Labs</h2></summary>

```python3
import perplexity

labs_cli = TEST.LabsClient()

# model = ['r1-1776', 'sonar-pro', 'sonar', 'sonar-reasoning-pro', 'sonar-reasoning']
# stream = returns a generator when enabled and just final response when disabled
print(labs_cli.ask('Your query here', model='r1-1776', stream=False))

for i in labs_cli.ask('Your query here', model='sonar-reasoning-pro', stream=True):
    print(i)
```

</details>

## Asynchronous API
Below is an example code for simple usage, without using your own account or generating new accounts.

```python3
import asyncio
import perplexity_async

async def test():
    perplexity_cli = await perplexity_async.Client()

    # mode = ['auto', 'pro', 'reasoning', 'deep research']
    # model = model for mode, which can only be used in own accounts, that is {
    #     'auto': [None],
    #     'pro': [None, 'sonar', 'gpt-4.5', 'gpt-4o', 'claude 3.7 sonnet', 'gemini 2.0 flash', 'grok-2'],
    #     'reasoning': [None, 'r1', 'o3-mini', 'claude 3.7 sonnet'],
    #     'deep research': [None]
    # }
    # sources = ['web', 'scholar', 'social']
    # files = a dictionary which has keys as filenames and values as file data
    # stream = returns a generator when enabled and just final response when disabled
    # language = ISO 639 code of language you want to use
    # follow_up = last query info for follow-up queries, you can directly pass response from a query, look at second example below
    # incognito = Enables incognito mode, for people who are using their own account
    resp = await perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='auto', model=None, sources=['web'], files={}, stream=False, language='en-US', follow_up=None, incognito=False)
    print(resp)

    # second example to show how to use follow-up queries and stream response
    async for i in await perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', stream=True, follow_up=resp):
        print(i)

asyncio.run(test())
```

And this is how you use your own account, you need to get your cookies in order to use your own account. Look at [How To Get The Cookies](#how-to-get-the-cookies),

```python3
import asyncio
import perplexity_async

perplexity_cookies = { 
    <your cookies here>
}

async def test():
    perplexity_cli = await perplexity_async.Client(perplexity_cookies)

    resp = await perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='reasoning', model='o3-mini', sources=['web'], files={'myfile.txt': open('file.txt').read()}, stream=False, language='en-US', follow_up=None, incognito=False)
    print(resp)

asyncio.run(test())
```

And finally account generating, you need to get cookies for [emailnator](https://emailnator.com/) to use this feature. Look at [How To Get The Cookies](#how-to-get-the-cookies),

```python3
import asyncio

    await perplexity_cli.create_account(emailnator_cookies) # Creates a new gmail, so your 5 pro queries will be renewed.

    resp = await perplexity_cli.search('Your query here', mode='reasoning', model=None, sources=['web'], files={'myfile.txt': open('file.txt').read()}, stream=False, language='en-US', follow_up=None, incognito=False)
    print(resp)

asyncio.run(test())
```
